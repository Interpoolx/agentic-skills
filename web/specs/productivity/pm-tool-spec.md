# Nexus Project OS - Product Requirements Document

> **Template Type**: Advanced Feature Spec  
> **Version**: 1.1  
> **Date**: 2026-01-20  
> **Status**: Refined Sample

## 1. Executive Summary
**Nexus Project OS** is a high-speed, keyboard-centric project management platform designed for engineering and design teams. It moves away from the "form-heavy" traditional PM tools toward a command-palette-driven experience. Nexus combines deep git integration, automated sprint workflows, and real-time data synchronization to keep teams in their flow state.

## 2. Problem Statement
Productivity is hampered by:
1. **Tool Lag**: Large projects in current PM tools take several seconds to load or filter, breaking developer focus.
2. **Context Switching**: Teams constantly move between GitHub, Slack, and their PM tool to update status.
3. **Information Overload**: Lack of intelligent filtering makes it hard to see "What matters right now" in complex projects.

## 3. Goals & Success Metrics
- **Speed**: < 100ms for all UI interactions (filtering, sorting, navigation).
- **Adoption**: 50% reduction in manual ticket updates through GitHub sync.
- **Efficiency**: Users perform 80% of actions via the "Command Palette" without touching the mouse.
- **Connectivity**: Support deep two-way sync with 5+ developer tools (GitHub, GitLab, Sentry, etc.).

## 4. User Personas
- **The Engineer (Devin)**: Lives in the CLI and wants his PM tool to feel like an IDE—fast, hotkey-driven, and git-aware.
- **The Product Manager (Alice)**: Needs high-level roadmaps that automatically update based on PR merges and story point velocity.
- **The Executive (CEO Bob)**: Wants a clean view of milestones and delivery risks across the entire organization.

## 5. User Stories
- As an engineer, I want my tickets to auto-move to "In Review" when I open a PR on GitHub.
- As a PM, I want to use natural language to "show me all blocked tasks for the mobile app" across 5 diferentes projects.
- As a user, I want a "Local First" experience so I can manage my tasks offline during flights.

## 6. Functional Requirements
### 6.1. High-Performance Kanban & Grid
- Virtualized lists supporting 10,000+ tasks with instant sorting/grouping.
- Command-palette (`Ctrl+K`) for all actions: creating tasks, changing assignees, moving statuses.
- Multi-dimensional views: Kanban, Table, Timeline (Gantt), and "Focus Mode."

### 6.2. Two-Way Dev Sync
- Native GitHub/GitLab integration: Link branch names to task IDs for automatic state transitions.
- Sentry/LogRocket integration: Auto-create high-priority bugs from production errors.
- Webhook engine for custom CI/CD pipeline triggers based on task status.

### 6.3. Advanced Automation (Vibe-Flow)
- Visual "if-this-then-that" builder for internal workflows.
- Auto-assignment logic based on team load and specialty.
- Weekly "Pulse" reports generated by AI using task completion data.

## 7. Technical Requirements
### 7.1. Database & Sync (PostgreSQL / Local-First)
- WatermelonDB or Replicache for the local-first architecture and sub-100ms UI latency.
- PostgreSQL with Logical Replication for real-time synchronization between clients.

### 7.2. Frontend (Vite / React / Tailwind)
- Optimized React rendering with `memo` and `useTransition` for smooth list animations.
- Custom keyboard management layer for complex hotkey shortcuts.

## 8. Data Model
| Entity | Key Attributes | Relationships |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Workspace | id, slug, owner_id | 1:N with Projects |
| Project | id, title, default_view | 1:N with Tasks |
| Task | id, title, status, priority, git_branch | 1:N with Comments |
| Automation | id, trigger, action, is_active | Linked to Project/Workspace |

## 9. API Specification (Selected Endpoints)
- `GET /v1/tasks/sync`: Incremental sync of task changes since last timestamp.
- `POST /v1/commands/execute`: Endpoint for the command palette to process bulk actions.
- `POST /v1/integrations/github/webhook`: Handles incoming git events to update task states.

## 14. Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Phase 1**: Local-first Sync Engine & Core Kanban UI (MUST).
- [ ] **Phase 2**: Command Palette & Keyboard shortcut system (MUST).
- [ ] **Phase 3**: GitHub/GitLab Two-way synchronization logic (SHOULD).
- [ ] **Phase 4**: Visual Automation Builder & AI Reports (COULD).
